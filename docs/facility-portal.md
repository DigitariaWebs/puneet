## NEW FEATURE: BEHAVIOUR TAGS

Location: Pet Profile → new "Internal Tags" block (staff-only, never customer-facing). How it works

1. Master list in Settings → Pet Settings → Behaviour Tags
   - Each tag = name + colour (hex) + icon (optional)
   - Default starter set:
     - Barker
     - Mounting
     - Food Aggressive
     - Escape Artist
     - Shy / Nervous
     - High Energy
     - Senior / Fragile
     - Medication Required
   - Don't put the coloured dots we need to come up with nice icons or something.

2. Assign unlimited tags to any pet (multi-select chips).
   - Show up as coloured pills at top of pet profile.
   - Auto-print on:
     - Boarding Card (kennel door)
     - Daily Care Sheet (clipboard)
     - Check-in/out modal header
     - Grooming & Training appointment cards

3. Smart warnings
   - During check-in: if "Food Aggressive" → auto-suggest solitary kennel.
   - During play-group assignment: if "Mounting" or "Escape Artist" → flag manager.

4. Filter & Report
   - Kennel View filter: "Show only pets tagged Barker"
   - Reports → Behaviour Tags summary (count per tag, per stay, per facility)

5. Permissions
   - Only staff with "Edit Pet" right can add/remove.
   - Read-only visibility for all other roles.

## VISUAL INTEGRATION POINTS

- Pet avatar corner: tiny coloured icons = first 3 tags (hover to expand).
- Reservation calendar: colour bar under pet name = highest-priority tag.
- Mobile app / kiosk check-in: red warning strip if any tag marked "Caution".

- Pet-Collar Printer Integration - print bright, temporary ID bands at check-in
  (works with industry-standard* PetDetect(r) *or any thermal printer that accepts 1" or 1.5" collar media)

## 1. What it prints (all fields come from the pet / booking screen - zero re-typing)

- Pet first name & owner last name (large text)
- Coloured stripe = care-alert level
  - Red stripe = on medication or alerting like this dog has some special notes so staff can check in the account like if the dog can bite if touched in the paws and things like that custom notes.
  - Amber = senior / special needs
  - Blue = behaviour tag (barker, mounting, etc.)
  - Green = standard guest
- Small icons: feeding schedule, meds, escape-risk, diet
- Facility logo + phone (repeats every 6" so it's visible from any angle)

The collar length is stored per pet; software auto-chooses 12", 18", 24" or 30" roll.
